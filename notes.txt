OTA Updates:
    
    When the time comes to update the certificate (15 December 2021), we can have both
    certificates here at the same time (one after the other in the same string, just
    like the mqtt_primary_backup.pem certificates). 
    We must just make sure to send an OTA update with the new certificate (as well as
    the old one) before the old one expires. Thereafter we can send another OTA update
    with only the new certificate (probably not necessary though).
